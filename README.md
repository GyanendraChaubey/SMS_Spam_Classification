# SMS_Spam_Classification

I have worked on is SMS_Spam_Classification using the Bag_of_words and Tf-idf using the Random Forest Classifier. In this work, I had a csv file containing labels and messages. As a preprocessing on messages, I have removed non-alphnumeric characters, convert the text to lowercase, tokenises the text into words, removed stopwords, stem the remaining words, and then reconstruct and stored the cleaned text as corpus. I have also converted the labels into the dummy values. Then I have split the corpus and target variable into 70 and 30 ratios for training and testing.  Afterwards, I have used CountVectorizer (Bag of Words) for the features extraction (Maximum features =2500) from the training data. I have fit it and dump the vectorizer as pickle file so that it can be used during inferencing. Then, I have fit the RandomForest Model and recorded its accuracy on the test data 98.3%. Similarly, I have TfidfVectorizer for the features extraction and trained it on same Random Forest Classifer and get an accuracy of 98.14% on test data.
